# CoinTrack
# introduction:
Coin Track: A Banking Application aims to provide users with a convenient and user-friendly banking experience.
The application offers a range of features, including account creation, deposit functionality, fund transfers, and more. 
With the increasing reliance on mobile devices and the need for seamless banking transactions.

# Project Details:
This Banking app made for Android using Android Studio. No real money is involved, it is a project to showcase my knowledge and practical skill in Android development with Java. The Application was developed using proper programming conventions, including documentation, error/exception handling, thorough program structure and memory efficiency.

The app starts out with a login screen, in which the user can either log in with an existing profile, or click a button and create a new profile. When signed in, the user will be brought to their dashboard page, which (when first creating a profile), will prompt them to make their first account. Additionally, there is a menu that slides from the left which includes all of the options for the app, including Dashboard, Account Overview (and subsequently Transactions), Deposits, Payments, Transfers, Profile Settings and Logout.
